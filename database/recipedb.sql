If you have an electric stove, heat a cast iron pan on high and place the peppers in the pan, allowing the peel to blister and blacken, turning so that all sides get blackened.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.simplyrecipes.com/photos/roasted-bell-peppers-1.jpg?ea6e46\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" alt=\"roasted-bell-peppers-1.jpg\" title=\"Broil until blackened on all sides\"><img src=\"http://www.simplyrecipes.com/photos/roasted-bell-peppers-2.jpg?ea6e46\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" alt=\"roasted-bell-peppers-2.jpg\" title=\"Remove stems, seed pod, seeds\"></p>\n\n<p><b>3</b> When the peppers are all well blistered and blackened, place in a non-reactive bowl and cover.
